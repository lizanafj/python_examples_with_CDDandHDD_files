## Overview of the examples

Working with netCDF4 files at global or national scale. 

	-(1) Read, analysis, and visualisation of NetCDF4 files with CDD and HDD

	-(2) Descriptive statistics of the CDD and HDD dataset.

	-(3) Spatial analysis of scenarios – distribution of mean values per subregion. 

	-(4) Climate variability – 10th percentile, median and 90th percentile per subregion.

	-(5) Analysis per country – CDD and HDD analysis in specific countries.


#### Install dependencies (use Python3)

```python

pip install -r requirements.txt

```
